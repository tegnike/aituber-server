# Beautiful Girl OpenInterpreter

[ [Japanese version](./README.md) | [English version](./en_README.md) | [简体中文](./zh_README.md) ]

## Note

- (16/10/2023) I'm currently pinned to version 0.1.7 of Open Interpreter due to an error in the latest version (0.1.9) that prevents WebSocket from sending in chunks.
- (16/10/2023) I changed repository name from "nike-open-intepreter" to "nike-open-interpreter" because of misspelling.
- (11/11/2023) I removed version 0.1.7 pinned of Open Interpreter because I could check it works correctly in the latest version (0.1.13).
